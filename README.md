# Typing Game
This game is a WebDev project using HTML, CSS and JS. Here you have to first start by clicking on the start button, then type the word exactly as the word highlighted in yellow to progress to the next word. Typos will highlight your text in red and won't let you advance to the next word until you correct it.

To view the deployment, go to: https://soarinskysagar.github.io/typing-game.github.io/
